										<p><h4>PLTW: Introduction to Engineering Design </h4>This computer intensive course is one of two introductory courses in the Project Lead the Way engineering
program that is offered through the STEM Academy. Introduction to Engineering Design teaches students
the process of product design through the use of CAD and computer modeling software. Students use a
problem-solving model to improve existing products and invent new ones. They also learn how to apply
this model both in and out of the classroom. Emphasis is placed on analyzing potential solutions, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, and communicating the ideas to others. </p>
<p><h4>PLTW: Principles of Engineering Design </h4>This course provides an overview of the world of engineering. Students will develop problem-solving
skills by tackling real-world engineering problems. This course provides a hands-on approach to science,
math, and technology. Through theory and practical hands-on experience, students will become familiar
with the multifaceted career of engineering. This course will explore the following topics: mechanisms,
energy sources, energy applications, machine control, fluid power, statics, material properties, material
testing, statistics, and kinematics. </p>
<p><h4>PLTW: Aerospace Engineering</h4> This course engages students in engineering design problems related to the world of aviation and space
travel. Using hands-on, project based learning, students will explore concepts related to: aerospace
information systems, astronautics, rocketry, propulsion, the physics and biology of space science,
principles of aeronautics, aviation structures and materials, and systems control engineering.</p>
<p><h4>PLTW: Civil Engineering and Architecture </h4>This course offers students the fundamental knowledge and experience to apply mathematical, scientific,
and engineering principles to the design, development, and evaluation of a property. Classroom instruction
provides creative thinking and problem-solving activities using software that allows students to design, test,
and evaluate a variety of civil engineering and architecture based problems. </p>

										<h4>C02 Car</h4>
										<p>One of the big projects in the engineering classes is their C02 powered racecar. In this project, students create a C02 and the car has to be within certain specifications. This is similar to the dragster event in TSA. The student that can make the fastest car wins.</p>
										<h4>Glider design</h4>
										<p>Another project in the engineering classes is the glider design project. In this project, students create a glider that has to fly when thrown in the air. The student with the longest in air time wins the competition. </p>
										<h4>Model Rocket</h4>
										<p>At the end of year, students participate in a model rocket competition. In this competition, students create model rockets that are launched into the air. The student with the rocket that goes the highest wins.    </p>
										<h4>VEX Robot</h4>
										<p>In principles of engineering and design, students create vex robots that are supposed to complete certain tasks. This is similar to the vex competition that PATSA has. The student that creates a robot that can complete the most tasks wins.     </p>
										<h4>Fundraising</h4>
										<p>This year, students in TSA fundraised by 3d printing key chains are selling them to the students at Manheim Township High School	. The TSA club also sold keychains to other clubs, such as the astronomy club.  </p>
