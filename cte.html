										<p><h4>PLTW: Introduction to Engineering Design </h4>This computer intensive course is one of two introductory courses in the Project Lead the Way engineering
program that is offered through the STEM Academy. Introduction to Engineering Design teaches students
the process of product design through the use of CAD and computer modeling software. Students use a
problem-solving model to improve existing products and invent new ones. They also learn how to apply
this model both in and out of the classroom. Emphasis is placed on analyzing potential solutions, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, and communicating the ideas to others. </p>
<p><h4>PLTW: Principles of Engineering Design </h4>This course provides an overview of the world of engineering. Students will develop problem-solving
skills by tackling real-world engineering problems. This course provides a hands-on approach to science,
math, and technology. Through theory and practical hands-on experience, students will become familiar
with the multifaceted career of engineering. This course will explore the following topics: mechanisms,
energy sources, energy applications, machine control, fluid power, statics, material properties, material
testing, statistics, and kinematics. </p>
<p><h4>PLTW: Aerospace Engineering</h4> This course engages students in engineering design problems related to the world of aviation and space
travel. Using hands-on, project based learning, students will explore concepts related to: aerospace
information systems, astronautics, rocketry, propulsion, the physics and biology of space science,
principles of aeronautics, aviation structures and materials, and systems control engineering.</p>
<p><h4>PLTW: Civil Engineering and Architecture </h4>This course offers students the fundamental knowledge and experience to apply mathematical, scientific,
and engineering principles to the design, development, and evaluation of a property. Classroom instruction
provides creative thinking and problem-solving activities using software that allows students to design, test,
and evaluate a variety of civil engineering and architecture based problems. </p>
